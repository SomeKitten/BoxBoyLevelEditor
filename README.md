# BoxBoyLevelEditor
Level Editor for BoxBoy!

This is still very much a WIP but the main functionality is run from the `MapEditor.py` file.
If you run that it should prompt you for the original extracted directory of BoxBoy! game files as well as a new folder
to place the decompressed and extracted map data.
